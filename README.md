# Big-Project

# Problem
- So hard to lock in 
- There are existing apps to block sites/apps that distract me
- But I can just delete them whenever I want
- There's no external forcing keeping me from deleting the app/extension
- There also needs to be a way to disable the distraction blocker for emergencies that I MUST open the blocked site
- But this can just be gamed and repeated

# Solution
- distraction remover extension/website blocker

- block yt and instagram for example
- but you can always delete the app right, or bypass it with a security question 

- if you have to open youtube, you must get a code sent to one of your friends (accountability)
- if you delete the extension, it will tell all ur friends ur distracted
- or like $5 to sick kids foundation
- sell all ur stocks
- delete ur social media accounts

- some way of actually holding u accountable that when u override the distraction blocker, it punishes u
